A simple browser mostly aimed at allowing you to log into multiple
different sessions/accounts at once. E.g. different gmail accounts, twitter
accounts, etc.

- google mail (normal or for domains), apps in general
- twitter
- android market

Optional features:

- select application type from template, enter username/password,
  auto-login ("keychain")

TODO:
- app title from active tab
 (requires communication between parent/child)
- definition of session profiles (?) / apps?
-
